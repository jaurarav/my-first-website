                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>For the Galea Garden project, our group decided to research different plants that are used as remedies for headaches. I started out by researching using Elicit and got read through some papers there. I found interesting papers on the Butterfly Pea Flower which had lots of cultural significance and relation to headache treatment. There are some papers that have started to look into researching the components of this flower and plant for the treatment of headaches. It would really interesting to delve deeper into the cultural and scientific side for this plant (and for other plants). I have a greater appreciation for the remedies nature has provided us with and I think delving deeper into this opens doors for a lot more exploration into other plants associated with traditional medicine for different types of remedies.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p><strong>2D Animation</strong></p>
            <p>I had a lot of fun learning more about 2D animation and exploring how to create frame by frame animations. I think as I continue to work on it more, I will get better and better at it.</p>
            <p><strong>Prototyping</strong></p> 
            <p>I initially thought Figma had a feature for scrollytelling however it doesnt. I even watched a few tutorials on Youtube trying to stimulate a scroll approach, where items could pop up when you hover on the screen however this is hard to perfect with the layout. In the end, I just decided to have placeholder images to show where they would be placed once a user scrolls to that place. I also created a prototype of the garden flow and how the user would be able to click on a plant and how the overlay information would appear. This part was easy to communicate. After communicating with Shay, I will try to simulate the scrollytelling through Adobe After Effects.</p>
            <p><strong>Background Development</strong></p>
            <p>For the background development, I took a lot of inspiration from different artists on pinterest and instagram. I really wanted to create a background that has a lot of soft greenery and warmth to it. As I was testing about Procreate Dreams, I found many artists tutorials where they work with a lot of nature landscapes. Through their work, I also gained a lot of inspiration and going forward, I will start creating a background for the website using different elements from the inspiration.</p>
