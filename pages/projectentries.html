                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>For the Galea Garden project, our group decided to research different plants that are used as remedies for headaches. I started out by researching using Elicit and got read through some papers there. I found interesting papers on the Butterfly Pea Flower which had lots of cultural significance and relation to headache treatment. There are some papers that have started to look into researching the components of this flower and plant for the treatment of headaches. It would really interesting to delve deeper into the cultural and scientific side for this plant (and for other plants). I have a greater appreciation for the remedies nature has provided us with and I think delving deeper into this opens doors for a lot more exploration into other plants associated with traditional medicine for different types of remedies.</p>

                <p>I explored frame by frame 2D animation, using Procreate Dreams. More details on this can be explored <a href="technologyexperiment.html">here</a>.</p>
                <p>I tried creating prototypes using Figma to get a feel of the scrollytelling interface.</p>
                <p>I took lots of inspiration from animators and pinterest for the background design.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This lab was very interesting in terms of understanding the different languages. As I went through the lab, I eventually realized how the small extra edits in code can cause errors and not show anything. I had a lot of fun changing colours for each page. Understanding the column layouts in the footer was so interesting! Eventually, as I started to learn the codes better, I became open to experimenting a bit more and utilize CoPilot for any help or quick error fixes. It's also hard to visualize the placement of the images at first but eventually I realized how the spacing works based on screen size. Overall, it's been interesting and fun to learn the relationship between codes and how it comes to fruitation in the website!</p>
