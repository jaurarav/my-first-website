                <p>In this technology experiment, I took a dive into Procreate Dreams! I will be doing 2D frame by frame animation for part of my MRP and I was testing out different softwares to accomplish this! </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p><strong>Procreate dreams seems like a dreamy animation tool that I hope to get better at!</strong></p>
            <p>I wanted to try a garden scene that could be used in my group project's final storytelling. I tried to animate different types of animals at first, such as a cat walking and bunny hopping, however that was difficult at first because I was still watching a lot of tutorials and getting used to the user interface of procreate dreams. I am excited to continue to explore this software for more of my MRP!</p>
