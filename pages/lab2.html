            <div class="learning-section">
                <h3>CSS Layout Techniques</h3>
                <p>In this lab, I explored two powerful CSS layout systems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexbox</strong> - Perfect for one-dimensional layouts like navigation bars</li>
                    <li><strong>CSS Grid</strong> - Ideal for two-dimensional layouts like image galleries</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="learning-section">
                <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                <p>I learned how to make websites adapt to different screen sizes using media queries. This ensures my
                    site looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This lab was very interesting in terms of understanding the different languages. As I went through the lab, I eventually realized how the small extra edits in code can cause errors and not show anything. I had a lot of fun changing colours for each page. Understanding the column layouts in the footer was so interesting! Eventually, as I started to learn the codes better, I became open to experimenting a bit more and utilize CoPilot for any help or quick error fixes. It's also hard to visualize the placement of the images at first but eventually I realized how the spacing works based on screen size. Overall, it's been interesting and fun to learn the relationship between codes and how it comes to fruitation in the website!</p>
